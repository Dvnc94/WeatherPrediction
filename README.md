# WeatherPrediction
The project aims to display a correlation between temperature, humidity, rain, wind speed for the period of 10 years in Szeged, Hungary and train a model to predict temperature for next 5 days. 
Following were used -
Python Libraries - Pandas and Numpy to clean data.
Machine Learning techniques - Decision Trees and Artificial Neural Networks to train the model.
Matplotlib to visualize results.
